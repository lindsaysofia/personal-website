        <p>A lifelong learner,</p>
        <p>I like to push my limits</p>
        <p>And unearth knowledge.</p>
        <p>Obviosuly there is a reason I didn't pursue a career in language arts, but in all seriousness, I am passionate about problem-solving. Software engineering has captured my interest for years, and I'd love to pursue a career in it.</p>
